				“This was dance that never seemed to stop, even in those curvilinear poses. Should we dare compare it to George
				Balanchine's work with the New York City Ballet, where ballerinas seemed to float while seemingly encased in a
				simple fifth position? Like NYCB, Sen's dancers would erupt into movement that surged across the stage with
				remarkable speed and agility!”

				“Excellence doesn’t sneak up on you; it walks right up and shakes your hand!<br/>... Watching Sen’s
				choreography is like encountering a chef with a perfect palate or a singer with perfect pitch. The sense of
				proportion and balance is immaculate. A line of dancers will shift, stamp and swirl in unison and imperceptibly
				one of them will glide back from the group to pose and watch. Sen has an unerring sense of when to keep dancers
				in formation and when to vary the picture as if she could anticipate the audience’s desires. Her use of space is
				similar. The patterns aren’t complex; they’re simply right.”

				“Surupa Sen performed a magical mime solo in which she acted out a jealous scene between Krishna and Radha,
				followed by Krishna’s guilty plea for forgiveness, all based on a twelfth century poem. As she mimed the words
				“you are the universe…the limpid crescent moon resting in your hair,” her eyes softened, her fingers traced the
				delicate line of the moon, and then shimmered around her body. She seemed to emanate light. Time stopped. Not
				many dancers, in any style, can manage this.”

				“In the evening’s pièce de résistance, artistic director and choreographer Surupa Sen brilliantly met the
				challenge of classical dance: how it might speak in the language of now without being wrenched from its
				foundation.<br/>In her meditation on Shiva, which she performed with stunning long-time troupe member
				<a href="/bijayini" class="bodylink">Bijayini Satpathy</a>, Sen did not forgo the iconic gestures: the flaming
				claw of a hand for Shiva rattling his drum or the palm waving beside the head for the Ganges flowing from his
				locks. But she scaled the steps to intensify the poetry and multiply the meanings. Sometimes you zoomed in – on
				a heel slowly touching the ground or on eyes crossing in mad zeal – and sometimes you zoomed out to take in the
				dancers’ fiery gallop or the weave of steps between them.<br/>The effect was like having a third eye and seeing
				everything all at once. Of the Indian dance I have encountered, I have never been so dazzled or so moved!”

				“Nrityagram, on the far outskirts of Bangalore, has clearly been extremely conducive to the creativity of these
				superb dancers, giving them time and space to reflect on their dance form in order to determine which boundaries
				they may cross and which they must honour. Their performance bore witness to the fine judgement with which they
				have done so, introducing new movements, interpretations and energy into their dance without betraying the grace
				and sculptural features that form the backbone of Odissi.”

				“You could write an essay just about the different effects of Ms. Sen’s shaking hands: musical like vibrato or
				trills, expressive of emotional agitation, giving a shimmer to images like flames or the love marks left on

				“According to tradition, largely a solo form, Indian classical dance has succumbed to the ensemble but rarely
				justified it. Nrityagram’s artistic director, however, transforms islands of activity into an archipelago that
				stretches across the stage. She zooms in on a dancer by having the others freeze in distinct poses like adjacent
				pages in a flipbook. She scatters our attention with troupers flitting in and out from the wings, and gathers it
				up again when they form a circle centre-stage ... Sen has writ large the romance between line and curve that
				distinguishes Odissi!”
