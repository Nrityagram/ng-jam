        “I dream of building a community of dancers in a forsaken place amidst nature. A place where nothing exists, except dance. A place where you breathe, eat, sleep, dream, talk, imagine - dance.

        A place where all the five senses can be refined to perfection.

        A place called Nrityagram.”

      A village of artistes dedicated to the practice and nurture of Odissi, a 2000-year-old classical dance of India, Nrityagram is home to a school inspired by the Gurukula, an ancient teaching paradigm, and an internationally renowned Dance Ensemble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to nurture dance professionals through the gurukula system, perform on a global stage and forge a community through outreach.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aspire to be a dynamic artistic community that practices and upholds the holistic traditions associated with the classical arts of India. A place that nurtures artistic growth and exchange, and enables deeper connections between people and art, beyond political, social and cultural differences.
